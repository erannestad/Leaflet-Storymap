Photo by Rachel Daniell.,,"The historic site now at Manzanar is also a unique case study in tensions between the present and the past, between the power of the state and the power of community activism.

Executive Order 9066 was a United States presidential executive order signed and issued during World War II by United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. Though it purpoted to apply to Italians and Germans in the US as well, only a small portion of these populations were incarcerated in US-based camps. Far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of relative population. Forced to urgently leave their homes, many people sold their homes at an enormous loss and lost their businesses.",-122.39875,37.79135

More than 24,000 men, women and children were confined. For many years, activists also advocated for recognition of this site of memory of state violence. Since in 1974, Tule Lake has, like Manzanar, been the site of pilgrimages by activists calling for an official apology from the U.S. government for the injustices to Japanese Americans, both citizens and non-citizens.

8,Manzanar Becomes a Historic Site Through Activism - A Unique Victory for Survivors of US State Violence,18,img/previous_park_sign_CA_not_federal.jpg,Source: California Historic Landmark signage. Photo by Rachel Daniell.,,"Manzanar occupies a curious position—one it shares with many other sites of memory—in that it commemorates the repressive actions of the same government that is its primary funder and architect. The U.S. gov- ernment manages this piece of land through the National Park Service, a bureau of the Department of the Interior. It is the same democratic government (although of course not the same administration) that in 1942 mandated the rapid incarceration of all Japanese Americans in the westernmost states, ripping people away from their homes and busi- nesses and confining them in tarpaper shacks under armed guard. During World War II, Japanese Americans were treated as enemies of the state solely based on racialized categories.",-118.1551,36.7269

Photo by Rachel Daniell.,,"Getting the state to recognize its own past acts of violence is only possible through pressure, as “only rarely does a nation call on itself to remember the victims of crimes it has perpetrated” (<i>see: Young 1992: 270, 270fn</i>). At Manzanar, this pressure came in the form of community ac- tivism. ",-118.1551,36.7269
